# Feeding dump1090 aircraft DB with vdlm2dec 
## Introduction
Modern versions of dump1090 comes with a webmap that uses a static database of json files to provide aircraft information.
Helas this database is often not very uptodate, and lots of aircrafts are lacking. Let's see if man could do something with acars data from vdlm2dec.

The json files are generated by the dump1090 tools : csv-to-json.py from cvs files of different origins.
The CSV format is very simple. The first line must be a header line that names three columns :

    icao24: the 6-digit hex address of the aircraft
    r: the registration / tail number of the aircraft
    t: the ICAO aircraft type of the aircraft, e.g. B773
    
the following lines contain airiraft data. IE :

    icao24,r,t
    484045,PH-MCI,B763
    400AA2,G-EZEJ
    405588,G-RIDA,AS55
    40415F,G-RICO,AA5
    406EFF,G-KIAN
    ...
    
 Note  that the aircraft type could be missing.

## Using vdlm2dec
I recently add to [vdlm2dec](https://github.com/TLeconte/vdlm2dec) an output mode (-a) that output this csv format from ACARS messages.
Only the icao address and aircraft registration could be extracted.
vdlm2dec  memorize for some time each aircraft it received and will output only one line for each.
So if man let's run 
 
> vdlm2dec -a 136.725 136.775 136.875 136.975 >> regs
 
For some suffiantly long time, man will have in regs , something like that :
    398501,F-HBIB
    393A6E,F-GOTO
    4066CE,G-TAWG
    495281,CS-TTA
    3C4903,D-ABHC
    ...
  
  that could be directly used for dump1090 database generation.
